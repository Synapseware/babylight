## About
The BabyLight isn't so much a baby light as it is a battery level and power on indicator for a cute little basket chair that the baby used to hang out it.  You know, one of those vibrating bouncy chairs.  Anyway, this project is more an experiment in building a small, power regulated board using a constant-voltage mode boost converter, a MOSFET and an RGB LED.  The chair is powered by a single D cell battery, so the board brings that battery level up to 5v so it can power the LED, the ATTiny85 and provide a high-enough gate voltage to switch the MOSFET to turn the vibration motor on and off.  The RGB LED shows randomly changing color patterns.  The cool thing about this project is it uses a pseudo-random method of picking the next color to show, and then using a time-based stepping algorithm to reach the new color in a set period of time (red to orange transition is very slow, while red to blue would transition faster since there are more colors between the two points).  This pretty much maxes out the 'tiny85's program space, and it could probably be more efficient, but it's more of a proving ground for some library functionality I thought I'd like to have support for.
